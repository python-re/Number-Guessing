# Number-Guessing

The file contained inside of this repository is a simplistic number guessing game that enables an end-user to guess a number from 1-50 with prompts stating whether the guess was too high or too low. End-user gets limited guesses before the program self-terminates and relays the correct response. Built in Python. There are plans to expand upon such code in the future.
